Implement the IDict interface backed by a list and binary search tree. Name the list backed implementation "Dict" and the BST backed implementation "BSTree". The files "shortlist.txt" and "words_alpha.txt" should not be committed to your repository.

You should copy over your best list implementation from day 4 to use as the list in the Test program.

Files:
Test.java  - A program that reads in words and randomly searches for them
IList.java - An interface for a list implementation (matches day4)
IDict.java - An interface for dictionaries
shortlist.txt - a 50000 word list
words_alpha.txt - a 370098 word list
DictList.java - program that makes a dictionary backed by an array list
Node.java - program that creates a node for a binary search tree
BSTree program that makes a dictionary backed by a binary search tree
DoubleDictCell - program that creates a node for DictList.java
